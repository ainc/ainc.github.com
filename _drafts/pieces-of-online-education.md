In case you haven't heard, there's a new movement afoot in education to help lots of people "learn to code". While the specific skills required for programming a computer may be of new emphasis, the process for learning these skills is not dramatically different from the processes we've used for centuries to educate our workforce.

Goals of Technical Education (from a purely economic perspective):

- provide people with the skills and experiences necessary to obtain jobs so they can earn income to provide for themselves and their families
- provide businesses with employees so that they can provide the goods and services needed by society
- provide a tax base so that our governmental bodies can provide basic services to society that are not feasibly provided by businesses or individuals

There are many other goals of the education process that should not be ignored, such as developing friendships, broadening horizons, building confidence, but those are for another post.

So, optimizing for the above, there are a few pieces of education for which there is tangible value:

- Content
- Instruction
- Assessment
- Credentialing
- Hiring

If you look at the major players in the education industry right now, they earn their revenue from providing one or more of these resources:

- Colleges and Universities: instruction, assessment, credentialing, hiring
- Textbook Providers (eg McGraw-Hill): content
- Private Tutors: instruction
- Testing Centers (eg Kaplan): assessment, credentialing
- Professional Societies (eg KSPE, AMA): credentialing
- Job Placement Agencies (eg Manpower): hiring

Once again, the opportunities in the learn to code iteration of technical education lie in providing one or more of these resources. So let's look at who's providing these right now:

- Content: Code.org, Codeschool.com, Codecademy, instructors on Udemy, Harvard/Stanford/MIT through Udacity/Coursera/iTunesU, LearnPythonTheHardWay, O'Reilly Media
- Instruction: high schools, colleges and universities, Dev Bootcamp, Big Nerd Ranch, self-taught
- Assessment: high schools, colleges and universities, The College Board (AP)
- Credentialing: tech certification (more IT than Software Development), GitHub/Stack Overflow/LinkedIn (social credentialing), topcoder
- Hiring: Stack Overflow Careers, LinkedIn, Dice

We're looking at these successful providers as a proxy for demand from learners, which may or may not be a good idea, but it's the best we've found so far. We're using this as we consider ways to provide this full spectrum of resources to our students at Awesome Inc U. Some of these resources we'll build internally, others we'll aggregate from the best sources. Right now, here's what we've got:

- Content: 1-day crash course (content provided by independent instructors), Udemy courses, Code.org content for Hour of Code sessions at schools
- Instruction: 1-day crash courses, Membership Program, on-site courses, Hour of Code, week-long camps (coming soon: Bootcamp!)
- Assessment: [nothing here yet!]
- Credentialing: certificate of completion for our topical courses
- Hiring: employer partnership program

Our assessment of this was spurred on by a request from a blacksmith-turned-software-developer (seriously, we're a sucker for horseshoe makers here in Kentucky). He has been using Codeschool.com for learning, and while they've been a great resource for him (we really like their TryGit and iOS courses), he wished that there were more assessment steps along the way. He felt as if this online course, like many, relied too much on the learner to validate his or her own progress. The emotional feeling it left him with is that the education providers are indifferent to his success or failure:

	I am realizing more and more that a lot of online places (that charge you $25-$30 a month just to use their courses) actually aren't super concerned, if in the end of taking their courses for a year, if you are really able to write any code on your own or not.

Perhaps this is why MOOCs have begun to adopt a Meetup.com-like
