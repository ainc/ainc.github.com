Since we started [Awesome Inc](http://awesomeinc.org) four years ago, three words have adorned the front glass of our office: technology, creativity, startups. These three word have a very intentional interplay, beyond the growing buzzwordiness of words like these and "innovation". We chose these three words because they are three of the essential ingredients for bringing new things to life. Change any one of them, and the system breaks. Technology, Creativity, Government just doesn't have the same effect.

While the concepts of Creativity and Startups certainly deserve their own discussion, our topic today is Technology. As I have [written about before](link to blog post about What is Technology), technology is everywhere. While this discussion will focus on software technology, I think that it's important to realize that the plastic material used to make the keys on which I am typing this are as important of a technology as the blogging engine that allows you to browse the web and read my posts. Not to mention the English language and Roman alphabet, two foundational types of technologies that have enabled many of the innovations and quality-of-life improvements that have followed. But, I digress. Back to code.

The power of software comes from its level of abstraction. Just like the human languages that help us describe everything from food, to manufacturing processes, to sporting events, software is capable of describing nearly anything. The difference is that the descriptions known as software are meant to communicate not with humans (at least not directly), but with computers.

All of this to say that we're at an unprecedented point in history. Most people in the first world (and increasingly many beyond), daily access to a computer is the norm. For many, a majority of their time is spent tethered to a computer for work or school, and then tethered to a powerful mobile computer for all their waking hours. And from both of these usage scenarios, these computers are tied together with every other computer in the world through a system known as the Internet. Every life on Earth is affected in increasingly powerful ways by software. Yet, only a small minority of the people on this planet know how to read, modify, or write code. We are at an inflection point similar to the time of Guttenberg, yet this change is even more powerful because it comes in the form of creation, not consumption.

Getting down to the nuts and bolts of this discussion, far too few people know how to code, and without a massive change in this area, our systems of government, healthcare, education, agriculture, finance, and the economy as a whole will suffer deterioration. Venture capitalist (and founder of Netscape, the first commercial web browser) Marc Andreesen famously coined the phrase "[Software is eating the world]()", to describe how a layer of software is being built on top of all parts of our civilization. This has already affected things like the American political process, where President Obama's tech team was seen as a major factor in securing his reelection. No longer a fancy toy for the rich, 

Fortunately, there is hope. When we launched [Awesome Inc U](http://awesomeincu.com), we were not the first to realize that our world needs to put the tools of software development in the hands of everyone. There are already a handful of great learn-to-code resources available that run the gamut from game creation for kids ([MIT Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu)) to free online courses in web development ([Codecademy](http://codecademy.com)) to intense semester-long bootcamps ([Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com)). While all of these pieces are necessary, we've chosen to start with one of the biggest barriers to coding: getting started. Recent studies on habit formation show that it's much harder to get started with a new habit than it is progress deeper toward expertise. Doing your first 5 pushups is probably more difficult than the next 500. This so-called "activation energy" (familiar topic for any chemists in the room) is what we intend to help our students overcome. As writing code evolves from a niche activity for the few to a broadly-practiced art, the tools and techniques will gradually be modified for a mass audience. Until then, writing code will remain an intimidating thing to newcomers. Intimidating, but far from impossible. In fact, as we have learned from the diverse group of nearly 100 newly-minted coders who have taken our courses this summer, anyone CAN learn to code. Just like riding a bicycle, playing an instrument, or cooking a meal, software development is a skill that just takes a little guidance and a lot of practice.

From startups to the star tech companies of the Fortune 500, from government and non-profits to sports and entertainment, software development is a highly sought-after skill. We're ready to help you get started. Are you ready to change the world?
